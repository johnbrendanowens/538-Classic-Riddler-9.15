My notebook can be found in the Jupyter Notebook section, but it is all preformed under the following principle. 

Triangle inequality princple

c â€“ b < a < c + b
or

{a + b > c, and    b + c > a, and    a + c > b}

The underlying basis of how I preceded is the triangle inequality principle. I haven't taken geometry since high school, so I relied on sparknotes and teacher websites. My understanding is that triangles can only be made by lines that meet the above criteria. I saw two different forms of it, and I decided to use the first rule. If this is incorrect, then everything moving forward is irrelevant to the questions
